# Fine-Tuning Project: AI Content Generator

## Problem Statement
The problem we aim to solve is the generation of high-quality and relevant content using artificial intelligence. Traditional content generation methods by `AutoGenerator` class often lack creativity and struggle to produce engaging, long, and informative content. Our goal is to leverage AI techniques to develop a content generator that can produce well-written and contextually accurate content across various domains.

## Goals
Develop a fine-tuned AI model capable of generating high-quality content from many other sources. Ensure the generated content is relevant, accurate, and coherent.

## Research Steps
1. `BlogGenerator` class: Use a website link to collect other sources and fine-tune the article

    **main function**: 
    - `generate_blog(website_link)`: generate the fine-tuning articles
2. (In-Progress): Grade the format in the generated article

    **main function**: 
    - `calculate_score(markdown_text)`: grade content in the 2 decimal score out of 5  from score 5 (highest) to 1 (lowest)

3. (Not started): Fix the incorrected format
4. (Not started): Train data by human-grading the fine-tune content

## Improvement/Problems
- Manage the produced data like sources
- Develop a interface to use
- Balancing the trade-off between generating creative content and maintaining accuracy.
- Improve to generate the content by a prompt OR keyword (Like Tavily system: https://tavily.com) (Might be In-Progress in Future Update section for CRO Web Crawl Project) 
- Incorporating user feedback to continuously enhance the content generator.
- Connect to the exsiting export sysytem and imported to Webflow
- Is it the right way to do the fine-tuning? Any suggestion for developing the system 

Please refer to the code snippets and documentation within this repository for more details on the implementation and progress of the AI content generator project.
